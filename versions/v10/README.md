# Beesness v10

There are currently three sub-versions of v10.

### What they have in common

* Everyone starts with 5 bee cards (2 workers, 2 drones and 1 queen), 2 flowers and 6 honey.
* Each player can play only one card per round. Place your chosen card face-down, and when everyone has made their choice, reveal the cards simultaneously, and resolve their actions in this order:
	1. queen(s)
	2. worker(s)
	3. drone(s)
* Workers (freelance = play & discard) can pick flowers
* Drones (also freelance) sell flowers for honey
* Queens (full-time = play & take back) hire freelance bees
* You get the maximum return for your chosen card when you're the only one playing it in a round. The more people play the same card, the less they get out of it.

### What they don't have in common

1. [**v10.1**](v10.1.md), aka *The Fixed Term*
	* 12 flowers in the commons to start with
	* 9 rounds, whoever has the most honey at the end is the winner
	* No *beesaster* (see below)
	* No flowers replanting at the end of each round
	* Flowers <-> honey conversion chart
	* In the last round workers become *gamblers* and queens become *speculators*
2. **v10.2**, aka *The Convoluted*
	* 12 flowers in the commons to start with
	* As many rounds as it takes the winner to get to 36+ honey
	* Replanting 1/3 of flowers left at the end of each round
	* Flowers <-> honey conversion chart
	* Compulsory die roll at the end of each round. if rolled number is bigger than flowers left, the game is over and everybody loses (aka **beesaster**)
	* *Beesaster* referendum with game-theory-style pay-offs.
3. **v10.3**, aka *The Realpolitik*
	* 9 flowers in the commons to start with
	* As many rounds as it takes the winner to get to 36+ honey
	* No Flowers <-> honey conversion chart. Instead, *honeypot* is 18H - number of flowers left in the commons
	* Blind bid for honeypot: winner takes it all, and losers still lose the flowers they committed
	* No flowers replanting at the end of each round. Instead, roll a special 6-sided die with numbers ranging from -3 to +2 (including 0), which determines how many flowers will be removed/added to the commons
	* *Beesaster* happens if the commons run out of flowers (either picked by players or decided by die roll)
	* *Beesaster* referendum with game-theory-style pay-offs & anyone can call a ref before the end-of-round die roll
4. **v10.4** Foragers, workers and drones
	* Foragers pick flowers. 3 max, -1 for each other active forager.
	* At the end of each round, replant a flower for each forager active on that round. This means that the mechanism to replant the garden already exist, but you need consensus to make it happen (and there could always be someone who uses a different card to take advantage of the situation).
	* Workers transform flowers into *products* (coloured boxes). 3 max, -1 for each other active worker.
	* There is no queen so all bees are full-time.
	* Drones sell products (instead of flowers). Sold products go into the garden, becoming a sort of landfill.
	* Blind bid for honeypot: winner takes it all, and losers still lose the flowers they committed.
	* Honeypot: 18 - F
	* Beesaster: if all flowers run out. Or if there is too much landfill (ratio between flowers and sold products)?

### Why so many versions?

**v10.1** was the first version of Beesness I wasn't ashamed of. Fellow designers at the PlaytestUK meetup in London really liked it, and so did friends & friendly strangers at several playtest sessions. The **simultaneous-action mechanic** (one card per round) produces quick and intense games, and everyone is constantly engaged as their actions depend on the other players. Also, the variance between player scores tends to be small, which means games are still open to at least two players until the end.

So that's a fun game. However, while optimising the *entertainment*, I parked element of the game which I still consider important. Let's call them the *critical* components: a collapsing ecosystem leading to *beesaster* (game over + everyone loses) and the democratic possibility of avoiding beesaster (through referendums).

I had a refreshing chat with Andrew Sheerin (designer of the infamous [War on Terror](https://www.terrorbullgames.co.uk/games/war_on_terror_game.php) and other brilliant games) about my struggle to combine a fun game with a critical agenda. His feedback was illuminating:

1. *Beesaster* in previous versions was the individual responsibility of the player who happened to be in the position to take the last flower. That gave such player the supreme power to end the game (and potentially ruin it for everyone else, which is why the PlaytestUK peeps didn't like it). Andrew suggested that it should be a collective responsibility.
2. The game should encourage players to stress-test the ecosystem. Andrew suggested to try and link the flower return to the number of flowers left, somehow. That way, players would be encouraged to starve the commons in order to maximise their returns.
3. Andrew also suggested to experiment with strong incentives to sell as little flowers as possible.

In short, adding interesting choices for players around the *beesaster*-related parts of the game. The aim is to create a tension between the selfish+competitive player motivation (aka the capitalist mandate) and the need to balance the ecosystem.
